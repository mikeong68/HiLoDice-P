        <!-- You are the Player.
        <br />
        You be playing with the computer.
        <br />
        Both starts with 20 Hit Points.
        <br />
        First one to reach 0 Hit Point LOSE.
        <br />
        <br />
        One dice has a value of between 1 to 6.
        <br />
        The seed with the highest value wins the round.
        <br />
        Winner increase Hit Points with total value of Dice(s).
        <br />
        Loser lose Hit Points with total value of Dice(s).
        <br />
        <br />
        Only player has Shield Points for Game Mode #2 and #3. Shield Points are
        insurance against Computer Dice having higher total values than 6; cause
        Computer has two dice(s). When Shield is activated, the increase /
        losing of Hit Points will just be the highest total value of the two
        players - instead of the total.
        <br />
        <br />
        i.e. Player = 5; Computer = 14 thus total value = 19
        <br />
        Shield ON - only 14 is used to adjust Hit Points while
        <br />
        Shield OFF - 19 is used to adjust Hit Points.
        <br />
        <br />
        Game Mode #2 - Player gets only 5 Shield Points.
        <br />
        Game Mode #3 - Player gets 5 Shield Points and is able to get more on
        reaching zero ( 0 ).
