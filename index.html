        You are the Player.
        <br />
        You be playing with the computer.
        <br />
        Both starts with 20 Hit Points.
        <br />
        First one to reach 0 Hit Point LOSE.
        <br />
        <br />
        One dice has a value of between 1 to 6.
        <br />
        The seed with the highest value wins the round.
        <br />
        Winner increase Hit Points with total value of Dice(s).
        <br />
        Loser lose Hit Points with total value of Dice(s).
        <br />
        <br />
        Only player has Shield Points starting from 5 in Game Mode #2 and #3.
        Shield Points are insurance against Computer Dice having higher total
        values than 6; cause Computer has two dice(s). When Shield is activated,
        the increase / losing of Hit Points will just be the highest total value
        of the two players - instead of the total.
        <br />
        <br />
        i.e. Player = 5; Computer = 14 thus total value = 19
        <br />
        Shield ON - only 14 is used to adjust Hit Points while
        <br />
        Shield OFF - 19 is used to adjust Hit Points.
